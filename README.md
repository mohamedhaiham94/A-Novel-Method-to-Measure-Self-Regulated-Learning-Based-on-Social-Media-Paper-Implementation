# A-Novel-Method-to-Measure-Self-Regulated-Learning-Based-on-Social-Media-Paper-Implementation

# Abstract
Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) draws many scholars’ attention because of the fast proliferation
of the quantity of information available to students and the advancements in educational technologies. This
paper targets introducing a new approach to measure higher education students’ adoption of Self-Regulated
Learning (SRL) strategies. The most common way to measure SRL is using very large or limited questionnaires, usually at the beginning of the term. The proposed approach is based on the administration of questions in small chunks over the term taking advantage of social media platforms (particularly Facebook). The
paper describes the contents and procedures of the novel approach and compares it against the well-known
Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ). Firstly, the MSLQ was applied for initial data
gathering (number of participants=344). Secondly, the new approach was administered via two Facebook
groups voluntarily (number of participants=170). The study included students from diverse disciplines in
different academic years. The findings show some differences between both instruments and reveal that the
administration of questions in small chunks along the term leads to more reliable and internally consistent
results (according to Cronbach’s coefficient values) and less affected by gender difference. Furthermore, SRL
measurement in the novel approach takes place over an extended period, introducing some variations in the
students’ answers. The results of a satisfaction questionnaire and interviews with non-active participants
indicate the positive role of social media in enhancing students’ participation and emphasize the need for
timely feedback to enhance the participation of students.
